# note:
# python doesnt built-support for Arrays,
# but list can be used insted of arrays
# creating array by using only one type of elements
cars = ["ford","Volvo","BMW"]
print(cars)
# length of arrays
leng = len(cars)
print(leng)
# accessing the elements
x = cars[0]
print(x)
print (cars[0])
y = cars[1]
print(y)
print (cars[1])
z = cars[2]
print(z)
print (cars[2])

# methods are same as list
